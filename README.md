Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption Tool
A simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation in Python.

Description
This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel of an image. The encryption method used adds a fixed value to each pixel value. 
This is a very basic encryption tool and should not be used for secure communication. The encryption method used here is very simple and can be easily broken. In a real-world scenario, you would want to use a more secure encryption algorithm.


Usage

~ Run the script and follow the prompts to enter the image path, message, and encryption key.
~ The program will encrypt the image and save it as encrypted_image.png.
~ The program will then decrypt the image and print the decrypted message.
